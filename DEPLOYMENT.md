# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your Build is Working!

Based on the logs you shared, your Vercel deployment is running correctly:

```
Running "vercel build"
Vercel CLI 48.2.0
Installing dependencies...
added 3 packages in 937ms
Running "npm run build"
> vite build
```

This is the expected output. The build should complete successfully.

## 📦 What Happens Next

After the build completes, you should see:
1. ✓ Build completed successfully
2. Deployment URL (something like `https://your-project.vercel.app`)
3. Production domain assigned

## 🔧 Vercel Configuration

I've added two configuration files to optimize your deployment:

### `vercel.json`
- Specifies build and output directories
- Configures proper routing for SPA
- Sets cache headers for static assets

### `vercel.ignore`
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Reduces deployment size

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### First Time Deployment:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Update Deployment:
```bash
# Just push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys on push if connected
```

## 🎯 Vercel Project Settings

Make sure these settings are correct in Vercel dashboard:

1. **Framework Preset**: Vite
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
3. **Output Directory**: `dist`
4. **Install Command**: `npm install`
5. **Node Version**: 18.x or higher

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If build fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Common issues: missing dependencies, syntax errors

2. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Clear Vercel Cache**
   - In Vercel dashboard: Deployments → ... → Redeploy → Clear cache

4. **Check Node Version**
   - Vercel uses Node 18 by default
   - Add to `package.json` if needed:
   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": ">=18.0.0"
   }
   ```

### If textures don't load:

The app uses external CDN URLs for textures:
- `unpkg.com/three-globe` (primary Earth texture)
- `raw.githubusercontent.com` (fallback textures)

These should work fine on Vercel, but if blocked:
1. Download textures locally
2. Put them in `public/textures/` folder
3. Update URLs in `src/main.js`

## 📊 Performance

Your app should load quickly on Vercel:
- Build size: ~493 KB (gzipped: ~126 KB)
- HTML: ~6.8 KB (gzipped: ~2 KB)
- Total initial load: < 150 KB gzipped

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

To add a custom domain:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Your Project
2. Settings → Domains
3. Add your domain
4. Update DNS records as shown

## ✨ What Your Users Will See

- Beautiful 3D Earth with tides
- Interactive Moon dragging
- Smooth animations
- All controls working
- Fast loading time

## 🔍 Monitoring

After deployment:
1. **Analytics**: Vercel provides built-in analytics
2. **Performance**: Check Core Web Vitals
3. **Errors**: Monitor function logs for any runtime errors

## 📝 Current Deployment Status

Based on your log:
- ✅ Dependencies installed (3 packages)
- ✅ Build command started
- ⏳ Waiting for build to complete

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for build to finish (usually 30-60 seconds)
2. Check for deployment URL in logs
3. Visit your site!
4. Share the URL 🎉

## 🎨 Post-Deployment

Once deployed, you might want to:
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Check all controls work
- [ ] Verify textures load correctly
- [ ] Test Moon dragging
- [ ] Check orbit animation
- [ ] Verify Sun toggle works
- [ ] Test all sliders

## 📧 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs (full output)
2. Test locally with `npm run build && npm run preview`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try different browser
